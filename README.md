Project PKL 2018

This is a web app that allows user to send a ticket for technical support.
It's a project that I created while I was an intern for 6 months as a requirement to graduate from vocational school.
Made with pure PHP (no framework) and used Carbon bootstrap template.

Future plan is to upgrade this project by using PHP framework (either CodeIgniter or Laravel, can't decide.). More features will probably
be added too.
